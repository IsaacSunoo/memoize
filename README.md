### Description:

Can you imagine a time without writing code without and provided array prototypes?  Array prototypes give you an incredible tool to solve problems.  This application is built as a study tool to learn all the array prototypes and test your knowledge.  Flash cards on all the methods are provided with the opportunity to quiz on them afterwards.

### Stretch Goals and Unimplemented Features:

The idea is to build out more study tools such as implementing a text editor to do on hands coding problems with the prototypes.  Better visuals and design would also like to be added as well as quiz questions being displayed individually instead of looking like a military quiz page.
